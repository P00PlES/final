This program simulates a the car-motorcycle situation that was explored during the midterm. This program takes the approach of having the motorcycles on either side of the car check behind and infront of them for space to slow down or speed up respectively.
If the motorcycle is able to move, the car is given a signal from the motorcycle to turn into the same lane as the bike, and the accident is avoided. If there is no space for either bike, then the car stays in the center to avoid harming the motorcyclists,
and the accident is not avoided.

This simulation is accomplished through creating classes of various objects in the situation described. It should be noted that every Vehicle object has a Road, and every Car, Truck, and Motorcycle is a Vehicle.
